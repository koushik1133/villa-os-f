 * The outbound heartbeat. Point a cron at:

 * Every few minutes it:
 *   1. starts any broadcast whose scheduled time has arrived
 *   2. keeps part-sent broadcasts moving, one batch per invocation
 *   3. auto-enrolls matching leads into active sequences
 *   4. fires every drip step that has come due
 *
 * Everything it calls is idempotent and claim-based, so overlapping cron
 * invocations (or a human clicking Send at the same moment) cannot
