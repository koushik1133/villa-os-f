/**
 * Scheduled follow-up dispatcher. Point a cron at:
 *   GET /api/cron/follow-ups   with   Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET
 *
 * WHY IT ONLY EVER SENDS TEMPLATES
 * A follow-up fires hours or days after the customer last wrote, which is
 * almost always outside WhatsApp's 24-hour customer service window. Outside
 * that window Meta only delivers pre-approved template messages — free text is
 * rejected, and repeatedly attempting it is how a business number gets rate
 * limited and eventually banned. villa_follow_ups.message may well hold a
 * nice AI-drafted sentence; this route deliberately never sends it. No
 * template_name, no send: the row is flagged for a human instead.
