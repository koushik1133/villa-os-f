 * also means the page needs no client JavaScript, and a slow query blocks the
 * download rather than a half-written file.
 *
 * The session cookie is checked by middleware before this handler runs — the
 * route is deliberately not on the public allow-list, so an unauthenticated
 * request gets a 401 rather than a dump of every lead.
