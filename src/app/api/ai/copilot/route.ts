/**
 * One question, answered over a fixed aggregate context.
 *
 * The model gets no tools and never writes SQL. That is the whole security
 * design: this process holds the service_role key, so a model able to compose
 * its own reads would turn any typed question — or any sentence a lead typed
 * into WhatsApp that ends up inside the context — into a query against every
 * table. Instead `gatherContext` runs a closed set of aggregates and the model
 * sees only their output. The worst a poisoned context string can do is make
 * the answer wrong, which is why the context is returned alongside the answer
 * and rendered next to it.
