/**
 * Broadcast engine.
 *
 * Three rules shape everything here, and all three come from Meta rather than
 * from taste:
 *
 *  1. A broadcast reaches people outside the 24-hour service window, so it can
 *     only ever be an approved template. Free text is not an option, and this
 *     module refuses to pretend otherwise.
 *  2. An opted-out lead must never be contacted again. That is checked at send
 *     time, not at audience-build time, because a customer can opt out in the
 *     minutes between the two.
 *  3. Sends are rate-limited. A tight loop over 5,000 numbers gets the number
 *     throttled or flagged, so this paces itself and is resumable.
 *
 * Each recipient is its own row with its own status, so one bad number fails
 * alone instead of stalling or silently truncating the rest of the send.
