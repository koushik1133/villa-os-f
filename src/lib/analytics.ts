 * Read-side analytics for the Overview dashboard and the /analytics section.

 * Two rules run through this file.
 *
 * 1. Every metric reuses the definition its reporting view already fixed —
 *    "qualified" is lead_score >= 50, revenue excludes cancelled bookings. A
 *    date-filtered query cannot use those views (none of them carry a date
 *    column), so the definition is repeated against the base table here and
 *    nowhere else, which keeps the two answers reconcilable.
 * 2. A zero denominator means "not knowable yet", never zero. Every rate
 *    returns null in that case so the UI can render an em dash instead of
 *    NaN or Infinity.
